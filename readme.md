# symfonyHistory

## Présentation
*symfonyHistory* is a site that is a resource for those who are interested in history. 
In this site you will be able to see different historical characters as well as the people who lived in their time. These characters are also associated with battles of their time.

You will also have the possibility to insert yourself a character in order to feed this database. You will have to create an access on the site. I will check if this character exists, and if he can appear in the database

This project is also a way to improve myself on the symfony 6 framework, by following the tuto of the channel [développeur musclé](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUiuGjup8Vg5t20nu7aaJDnbHlhzXbbuN).

## display of dates in twig files 
To have the date display I use directly the twig display. You have to download the format_datetime filter which is part of the IntlExtension:

> composer require twig/intl-extra

Ressources : [format_datetime](https://twig.symfony.com/doc/3.x/filters/format_datetime.html) 

**Of course this site is a draft and it will evolve.**
